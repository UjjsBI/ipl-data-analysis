## 📌 Objectives

- Perform detailed EDA using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib
- Identify trends in toss decisions and match outcomes
- Analyze top-performing teams across seasons
- Visualize insights with high-quality charts

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
